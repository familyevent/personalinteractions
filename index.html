            <td style="vertical-align: top"><b>recently while working on a group project</b>: my group members, very chill. after starting 15 late, we work on the project. skip ahead and now we are focusing on a key part: what makes success. one of the points was: faculty buy-in. i figure that buy-in is a term that begets money. so i suggested to say faculty "backing". one of our group members immediatedly said yes. the other (the original poster of the point) didn't not so much understand. and one immediatedy shot it down. so i ask, if this to be true with what we believe, then why not include backing? minus the use of a financial term.
